## **UX** 

### **User stories**

The application is designed to be a stock management system for comic creators. 

#### As a user, I expect:
* To be able to easily understand what information the application is asking for. 
* To be prompted to reorder stock when an item is running low. 
* To get reports after each input showing both gross and net profit in an easy to understand manner. 
* To be able to easily update sales.
* To be able to easily update stock. 
 
#### As a user, I want:
* To be able to see the data I am to input to confirm it is correct. 
* To be able to easily navigate through the data. 
* To be able to add additional books directly to the command line without having to manually modify the code or the spreadsheet. 

### **Flow Chart**
Before starting on the project, I created a mock up using lucid chart to break down the logic I would need to follow to ensure that the application worked correctly.
