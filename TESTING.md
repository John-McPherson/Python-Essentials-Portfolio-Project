## **Validation**
I ran my code through the [pep8online linter](http://pep8online.com/) to check for errors. The original code came back with the following errors;

![peponline fail](./assets/imgs/peponline-fail.png)

These were fixed in commit [1ef6d64](https://github.com/John-McPherson/Python-Essentials-Portfolio-Project/commit/1ef6d6481bbeb06daed090ac80b0ed134fbbc72d#diff-d6af0459a37d985953d7040c14f53feb3b9cc9e58b543aa3c2b80256d276c5e0). After that the code passed through the linter with no further issues;
